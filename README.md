# Analytica

> Track GitHub developers you care about. Discover what they're building, learning, and contributing to.

A web platform that helps you monitor GitHub activity of developers you want to learn from - classmates, mentors, or inspiring creators. Get insights into their tech stack, contribution patterns, and project activity in one unified dashboard.

**Live Demo:**[Analytica](https://www.analytica-frontend.vercel.app)
**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot, Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL

## Why Analytica?

Learning from others is hard when their activity is scattered across repositories, commits, and pull requests. Analytica solves this by:

- **Tracking developer activity** - See what projects they're working on, what languages they're using, and how active they are
- **Analyzing tech profiles** - Understand their expertise through language distribution, project complexity, and contribution patterns  
- **Finding similar developers** - Discover people with matching tech stacks and interests
- **Comparing progress** - Benchmark yourself against peers on contributions, repos, and languages

Built by a developer who wanted to learn from others' journeys without manually checking dozens of GitHub profiles.

## Known Limitations

- **Backend Hosting:** Render free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request may take 30 seconds - 1 minute to wake up.
- **Database:** Neon free tier has 100 compute hours/month and 500MB storage. Sufficient for demo use.
- **Rate Limiting:** GitHub API has rate limits. Excessive refreshes may temporarily block data fetching.

For production use, sponsor if you can.
